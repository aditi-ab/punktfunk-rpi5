# Build the punktfunk Linux client as a single-file `.flatpak` bundle.
#
# Works on the Steam Deck (org.flatpak.Builder from Flathub, user-scope, NO root) and on any
# Linux box with flatpak + flatpak-builder. The CI does the same steps (.gitea/workflows/flatpak.yml).
#
# On the Deck (one-time):
#   flatpak install --user -y flathub org.flatpak.Builder
# Then run this script from the repo root:
#   bash packaging/flatpak/build-flatpak.sh
# Output: dist/punktfunk-client-<version>.flatpak  (install with `flatpak install --user <file>`)
#
# Env knobs:
#   VERSION=...        version string for the bundle name (default: git describe / 0.0.1-dev)
#   ONLINE=1           skip offline cargo-sources.json; build with --share=network (fast local
#                      iteration, non-reproducible). Default: offline (regenerates cargo-sources).
#   BUILDER=...        override the flatpak-builder invocation (default: auto-detect host
#                      flatpak-builder, else `flatpak run org.flatpak.Builder`).
#   BRANCH=...         the flatpak branch to build and bundle (default: stable). A Deck tracking
#                      the hosted `canary` takes a test build as BRANCH=canary, replacing it in
#                      place — a second branch beside it would win the plain `flatpak run`.
#   ARCH=...           target architecture (default: this machine's). `aarch64` builds the arm64
#                      client — the manifest carries the per-arch PKG_CONFIG_PATH and the matching
#                      prebuilt Skia archive. NOTE this is not a cross-compile: flatpak-builder
#                      runs the build inside a sandbox for that arch, so building aarch64 on an
#                      x86_64 box needs qemu binfmt registered and is very slow. Run it on an
#                      arm64 machine.
