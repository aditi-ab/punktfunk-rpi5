//! The swap-chain drain worker: one thread per assignment that consumes the IddCx swap-chain (so
//! the virtual monitor stays a usable display) and hands each acquired surface to the monitor's
//! encode pool.
//!
//! The OS presents the composited desktop to the driver through a swap-chain; the driver MUST
//! consume it (acquire → finished-processing) or the monitor stalls. This binds the pooled render
//! device (`IddCxSwapChainSetDevice`), loops acquire/finish, and inside that window issues exactly
//! one fused GPU pass into a free pool slot — or drops at the pool. Nothing else: telemetry is
//! stamped after `FinishedProcessingFrame`, because the window is what DWM waits on for this head.
//! Which call comes next is `pf_driver_proto::drain::step`; this file maps each result into it.
//!
//! A bypass pool issues no pass where it can: the encoder reads the acquired surface, which
//! stays the driver's until the next acquire returns a frame. So the worker holds that acquire
//! until the access unit is out, and `FinishedProcessingFrame` still goes out at once. Once the
//! desktop goes still the worker copies that surface into the pool, the one pass of the run.
//!
//! The `wdk_iddcx` DDI wrappers return a RAW `NTSTATUS` (`i32`) that is HRESULT-shaped for the
//! swap-chain DDIs, so we classify it by hand (`hr >= 0` = success; `0x8000_000A` = E_PENDING;
//! `hr < 0 && != E_PENDING` = error) rather than with `nt_success`.
