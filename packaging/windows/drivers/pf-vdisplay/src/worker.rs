//! Thread + handle ownership for the driver's background workers.
//!
//! Two long-lived threads live in this driver: the cursor query→publish loop and the swap-chain
//! drain loop. Both used to hand raw `HANDLE` values to their thread and let the THREAD close
//! them at exit, which puts a handle's lifetime somewhere no owner can observe: a caller that
//! copied the value out under the registry lock can hand a closed — and by then possibly reused
//! — handle to a DDI. Everything here states the opposite rule: a handle or mapping belongs to
//! one value, its `Drop` closes it exactly once, and a thread only ever borrows what its owner
//! outlives.
//!
//! [`Worker`] owns the stop event and the join handle, so dropping it signals, joins, and only
//! then closes. [`OwnedHandle`] and [`OwnedView`] are the RAII wrappers for `CloseHandle` and
//! `MapViewOfFile`/`UnmapViewOfFile`.
