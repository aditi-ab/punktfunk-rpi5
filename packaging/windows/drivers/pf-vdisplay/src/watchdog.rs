//! Owner liveness: which host processes are alive, and reaping the monitors of one that is not.
//!
//! Every monitor belongs to the process whose `IOCTL_ADD` created it
//! ([`Monitor::owner`](crate::monitor::Monitor::owner)), and only that process reaches it
//! again. An owner ends two ways: its last control handle closes ([`evt_file_cleanup`] — a
//! crash closes every handle, so this is immediate), or it keeps a handle open and sends no
//! IOCTL for [`WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT_S`] (a hung host; [`evt_timer`]). Either way only that owner's
//! monitors are departed, and a second host on the box keeps streaming.
//!
//! The timer is a child of the device, so the framework deletes it with the device instead of a
//! thread outliving the monitors it reaps, and [`stop`] waits out a tick that is mid-reap before
//! cleanup walks the same monitor list.
