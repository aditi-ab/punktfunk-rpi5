//! Virtual monitors: the [`Monitor`] type and the control-plane verbs on it — create + arrive
//! (`IOCTL_ADD`), the in-place mode update, remove, clear, the owner reap and the encode
//! session; the cursor verbs live in [`crate::cursor`]. Every verb takes the calling process as
//! `owner` and reaches only the monitors that process added.
//!
//! Ownership: [`crate::registry`] holds the only strong `Arc<Monitor>`; the drain worker holds a
//! `Weak`. Every field a worker, a DDI callback or an IOCTL can race on sits behind its own
//! mutex, held for a field swap and never across a DDI, a join, or a `Drop` that closes a
//! handle. Lock order is `REGISTRY → Monitor.*`, never reversed; workers never take the registry.
//!
//! Removal is two steps with no lock held between them: the registry hands the `Arc` back, then
//! [`Monitor::teardown`] stops the workers (cursor first, then the encode session, the drain
//! worker, the pool), and only then does the caller run `IddCxMonitorDeparture`.
