//! `punktfunk-console.exe` — the couch/HTPC entry point.

//! Exists because an MSIX `<Application>` cannot pass ARGUMENTS to a full-trust executable:
//! a second Start-menu tile therefore cannot simply be "punktfunk-client.exe --console", it
//! needs its own executable. This is that executable, and it is deliberately nothing but a
//! hand-off — it starts the session binary's `--browse` mode (the complete controller-driven
//! client: host list, discovery, PIN pairing, settings, Wake-on-LAN, library) fullscreen and
//! mirrors its exit code, so whatever supervises this process sees the real result.
//!
//! `--windowed` keeps it in a window; everything else is the session binary's own business.

// No console window: this is launched from a Start-menu tile / shortcut, and a flashing
// console behind the couch UI looks like a crash.
#![cfg_attr(windows, windows_subsystem = "windows")]

// The shared client log sink (std-only): a couch launch has no console, so the session's
// stderr would otherwise evaporate — same reasoning as the shell's tee. This shim only
// initializes + forwards; the module's subscriber-side surface stays unused here.

// because the two copies of this hand-off had already drifted apart on that flag.
