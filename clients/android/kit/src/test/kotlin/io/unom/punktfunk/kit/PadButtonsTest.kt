 * has no key layout for. Only `KeyEvent`'s compile-time-inlined keycode constants are involved, so
 * no Android runtime is needed. Run: `./gradlew :kit:testDebugUnitTest`.
 *
 * The regression it pins is a field report from a Fire TV Stick 4K Max (2026-08-20): a DualSense
 * and an Xbox Elite Series 2, both over Bluetooth, both identified correctly but with buttons
 * landing on the wrong actions — "L1 being L2". Neither pad has a key layout on that box (AOSP
 * ships none for `045e:0b05` at all, and the DualSense's requires `CONFIG_HID_PLAYSTATION`), so
 * both fall back to `Generic.kl`, which names keycodes by scancode POSITION. A pad with no kernel
 * driver numbers its HID buttons 1..n straight through in its own report order, so every keycode
 * after the first divergence belongs to a different button.
 *
 * The table below is the pad's physical button on the left and where `Generic.kl` put it on the
 * right; the assertions read it back the other way.
