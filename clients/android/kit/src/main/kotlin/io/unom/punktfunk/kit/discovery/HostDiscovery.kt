 *
 * One per process, via [shared]: each instance is one mDNS daemon binding :5353 and joining the
 * multicast groups, so two of them contend for the same answers. Subscribers hold it up —
 * [addListener] starts the browse, and the last one out stops it after a short idle gap. Main

 * needs it. (The Android emulator's SLIRP NAT drops multicast, so on the emulator discovery starts
 * but never finds a LAN host — same as before; that's the network, not the API.)
 *
 * The daemon's sockets belong to the interface they were built on. A TV that moves from Wi-Fi to
 * Ethernet never backgrounds the app, so nothing else would rebuild them: the default-network
