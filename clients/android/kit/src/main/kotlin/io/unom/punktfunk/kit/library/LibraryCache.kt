// On-disk cache for a host's library CATALOG — the list of titles, not their art. The Android
// mirror of the Apple client's `LibraryCache.swift` and the Rust `pf_client_core::library_cache`.
//
// Cover art has been cached by Coil for a while; the catalog behind it never was. Every visit to a
// library refetched `GET /api/v1/library` and showed a spinner until that call returned. A host
// that is asleep, or simply not reachable yet, therefore had an EMPTY library — which is the
// opposite of what a player wants from the screen they use to decide what to play, and it makes
// waking a host on library entry pointless: there would be nothing to look at while it boots.
//
// So the catalog is cached per host and rendered immediately, marked stale, and reconciled when the
// host answers.
//
// Cache directory (`context.cacheDir`), not files: every byte is re-derivable from the host, so
// Android is welcome to evict it under storage pressure. Unlike art, a catalog is small (a few
// hundred KB for a big library), so there is no size budget here — one file per host, replaced
// wholesale.
//
// Takes a plain [File] directory rather than a Context so it can be unit-tested against a temp
// dir, exactly like the Apple original.
