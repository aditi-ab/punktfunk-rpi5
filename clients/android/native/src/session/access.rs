//! The session's access level over JNI — the Android leg of `design/per-client-access.md` §7.
//!
//! One poll shim: Kotlin reads `[grants, remainingSecs, updateSeq]` ~1 Hz (alongside its
//! session-ended watchdog) instead of holding a blocking event thread — access news is a
//! console edit or an expiry warning, a handful per session, and every gate the mask drives
//! re-checks within a second anyway. The connector already folds each mid-session
//! [`punktfunk_core::quic::AccessUpdate`] latest-wins into its live grants/deadline slots;
//! the seq counter here only exists so the poller can tell a FRESH update arrived (the host's
//! T−5 m / T−1 m warnings owe a toast) without diffing state that a warning doesn't change.

/// `GRANT_GAMEPAD`-family bitmask, seeded from the Welcome's advert (an old host reads as
/// `GRANT_ALL` — full control, today's behavior); `remainingSecs` counts down to the access
/// deadline on the CLIENT's clock (`0` = permanent, clamped to ≥ 1 once a deadline exists so
/// the sentinel can never be reached by counting); `updateSeq` increments once per
/// `AccessUpdate` drained from the connector's event plane. Not android-gated — pure `jni` +
/// connector reads, so it links on the host build too. Cheap; safe on the UI thread.
