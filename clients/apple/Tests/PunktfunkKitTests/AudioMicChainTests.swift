// The rate-dependent half of the mic chain (SessionAudio.micChain). The tap now installs with
// `format: nil` — a non-nil format is validated against the bus and raises an Objective-C
// exception on mismatch, which Swift cannot catch, so it aborted the whole app (SIGABRT in
// AVAudioEngineGraph::InstallTapOnNode, reported against 0.31.0). With nil the tap follows
// whatever the bus emits, which means the chain has to be rebuildable at the device's real rate.
// This pins the sizing arithmetic that rebuild depends on, without an engine, device or mic grant.
