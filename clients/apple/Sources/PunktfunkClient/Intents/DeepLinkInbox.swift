// The hand-off from an App Intent to the window that acts on its link.
//
// An intent runs in the app's process but outside any scene, and on a cold launch it can run
// before a window subscribes to the notification. So the link is held here as well as posted:
// a subscribed window takes it from the post, and a window that appears later finds it waiting.
