// The Siri Remote as a pointing device during a tvOS streaming session — the remote's touch
// surface drives the HOST cursor (relative deltas, like a laptop trackpad), a surface press
// clicks (left button), and Play/Pause right-clicks. It also owns the remote's DELIBERATE
// session exit: hold Back/Menu ≥ `disconnectHold`. A short Back press does nothing — the
// UIKit menu press it also generates is swallowed by ContentView's session branch, so neither
// a trackpad fumble nor a game-controller B press can end the session (the pad's exit is the
// L1+R1+Start+Select chord in GamepadCapture).
//
// The remote is read through GameController as a GCMicroGamepad with
// `reportsAbsoluteDpadValues = true`: the dpad axes then report the finger's ABSOLUTE position
// on the surface (±1, +y up), one axis per callback, and snap to exactly (0, 0) on lift, again
// one axis at a time. Successive positions are differenced into relative mouse deltas. The
// exact-zero snap and a quiet gap end a touch; the touch report (`buttonA.isTouched`) may end
// one early, but a clickpad remote reports its click there, so it never gates motion. Handlers
// (not a poll) — the same in-session delivery GamepadCapture relies on.
//
// Lifecycle mirrors GamepadCapture: started by SessionModel when streaming begins (never
// during the trust prompt), stopped on disconnect; held buttons are released on stop so the
// host never keeps a stuck click.
