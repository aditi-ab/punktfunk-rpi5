// Stream-mode presets grouped by aspect ratio — the twin of `punktfunk_core::resolutions` (and
// Android's `Resolutions` in Settings.kt). A picker shows one family at a time behind an aspect
// switch, plus its own native rows. Picking a family moves to its size nearest the current height
// (`nearest`), so the switch and the list always agree without picker-side state. Pure; tested in
// `ResolutionsTests`.
