// Safe-area stream sizing — the pure geometry behind the "safe area" resolution row.
//
// An iPhone clips the picture in HARDWARE: the sensor housing (notch / Dynamic Island) and the four
// rounded corners eat whatever the stream draws underneath them. The session view is deliberately
// edge-to-edge (ContentView's `.ignoresSafeArea()` on iOS) and the presenter aspect-FITS the host
// mode into it, so which pixels survive is decided entirely by the mode's aspect ratio:
//
//   * A 16:9 mode on a 19.5:9 phone pillarboxes, and those black bars land exactly on the unsafe
//     regions. That is why 1080p has always "just worked" and never needed a setting.
//   * The device's NATIVE mode has the screen's own aspect ratio, so it fills every pixel —
//     including the ones behind the housing and under the corner radii. That is the mode that
//     loses its corners, and the reason this file exists.
//
// So the fix needs no layout change and no input change: ask the host for a mode that is narrower
// by the safe-area insets, and the existing aspect-fit centres it inside the safe region. Pointer
// input keeps mapping correctly for free, because `hostPoint(from:)` derives the video rect from
// the live host mode (`AVMakeRect(aspectRatio:insideRect:)`) instead of assuming full-bleed.
//
// The formula is Moonlight's (its settings' resolution table carries the same row): full native
// height, width reduced by the left+right safe-area insets. Width-only is not a simplification —
// under aspect-fit only one axis can bind, and on a landscape phone that axis is always the
// horizontal one. Insetting the height too would shrink the picture without uncovering anything.

// A notched Mac is the same problem rotated: the camera housing eats the TOP of a landscape panel,
// so its safe mode is shorter rather than narrower.
