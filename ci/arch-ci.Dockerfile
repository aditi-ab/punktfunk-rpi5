# Arch CI builder: base-devel + every dependency arch.yml's two makepkg legs used to
# pacman-install per run (~1 GB of mirror traffic each time) + bun + sccache + nodejs
# (JS actions exec node INSIDE the job container — the same lesson as android-ci).
# Content-keyed and rebuilt only when the ci/ tree changes (docker.yml `builders`).
#
#   docker build -f ci/arch-ci.Dockerfile -t punktfunk-arch-ci ci
#
# ROLLING-RELEASE TRADEOFF, on purpose: packages now build against the Arch snapshot
# from the last image rebuild instead of a fresh -Syu per run. That is the same staleness
# the gamescope cache already embraces ("a stale binary against newer system libs is the
# same risk the distro's own package carries between rebuilds"), and any ci/ edit — or
# bumping the date in this line (refreshed: 2026-08-08) — re-keys and re-snapshots it.
#
# ⚠ AND KNOW WHY THAT IS NOT ENOUGH ON ITS OWN: bumping this date only helps once docker.yml has
# actually republished the image, and nothing sequences the two workflows. A release tagged four
# minutes after a system-library major once published a punktfunk-host that no up-to-date Arch
# box could install — which blocks the user's ENTIRE `pacman -Syu`, not just our package. So
# arch.yml refuses to publish anything a pristine-db `pacman -U --print` says is unsatisfiable.
# This file staying current is still the CHEAP path — that gate is the backstop, not the plan.

# One transaction: the main build/runtime deps (first list) + the gamescope companion's
# deps (second list) — both copied verbatim from what arch.yml installed in-job, where
# they now no-op as `--needed` guards.
# vulkan-headers rides the first list only because arch.yml's copy does; the package it actually
# serves is the gamescope companion (packaging/gamescope/PKGBUILD makedepends). punktfunk itself
# needs no system Vulkan headers — pyrowave-sys bindgens its own vendored copy and ash dlopens the
# loader — but arch.yml builds gamescope with `makepkg -d`, so an absent makedepend would not be
# reported as a missing dependency, only as a compile failure. Keep it.
