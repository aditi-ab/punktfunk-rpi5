# Cross-compiling CI builder: amd64 host toolchain + an arm64 multiarch sysroot, for the
# aarch64 Linux CLIENT artifacts (punktfunk-client + punktfunk-session).
#
#   docker build -f ci/rust-ci-arm64cross.Dockerfile -t punktfunk-rust-ci-arm64cross .
#
# Derived from punktfunk-rust-ci so the Rust toolchain, clang, and CMake are byte-identical
# to the amd64 legs — this image only adds the target side. Kept as a SEPARATE image rather
# than folded into the base because the :arm64 dev libs are ~1 GB that every other CI job
# would otherwise pull for nothing.
#
# Client only: the Linux HOST stays amd64 (its encode stack is NVENC/QSV/AMF), so none of the
# host's CUDA/GBM link deps are mirrored here.
#
# Ubuntu splits archives by architecture: amd64 lives on archive.ubuntu.com, every port
# (arm64 included) on ports.ubuntu.com. Both stanzas therefore have to be pinned with an
# explicit `Architectures:` or apt tries to fetch arm64 from the amd64 mirror and 404s.
#
# Built from the REPO ROOT context (not ci/) — see the rust-toolchain.toml copy below.

# 3. The Rust target — installed against the toolchain the WORKSPACE pins, not the image's
#    default. The base image bakes whatever `stable` was at its build time, while every build
#    in the repo switches to the exact channel in rust-toolchain.toml; adding the target to
#    the default toolchain instead leaves the pinned one without an aarch64 std, and the build
#    dies on `can't find crate for core` a few hundred crates in. Running rustup from a
#    directory that contains the pin file resolves the right toolchain (and pre-downloads it,
#    which every workspace job would otherwise pay for on first use).

# 4. Cross wiring. Everything in this image is a cross build, so the plain (un-suffixed)
#    variables are safe and cover the crates that roll their own pkg-config/bindgen calls
#    instead of going through the target-scoped lookups.
#      * PKG_CONFIG uses Debian's multiarch wrapper, which resolves the arm64 .pc files and
#        rewrites -I/-L into the sysroot without per-crate cooperation.
#      * BINDGEN_EXTRA_CLANG_ARGS: clang defaults to the host triple, so bindgen would parse
#        arm64 headers with amd64 type layouts (silently wrong, not a build error) — the
#        explicit --target plus the multiarch include dir is what keeps the layouts honest.
#      * CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_gnu routes HOST-targeted compiles through a wrapper that
#        strips the arm64 include dirs — see ci/pf-host-cc for the ffmpeg-sys-next probe it
#        exists for.
