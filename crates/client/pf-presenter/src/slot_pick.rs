//! The paced drain's slot pick: a frame is aimed at the first latch at least a lead past
//! its due time — one frame per slot — and goes out that lead ahead of it. The present
//! then sits at one phase of the panel's grid whatever phase the source clock drifts
//! to; a present at the due time lands wherever that clock puts it, and at the
//! compositor's deadline every frame is a coin toss. Pure; `PaceState::step` hands it
//! the latch clock and the frame store.
//!
//! The lead is half a period plus a margin: as far from the previous latch as from the
//! next. Missed slots widen the margin; frames landing a slot before their aim narrow it.
//!
