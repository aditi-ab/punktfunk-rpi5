//! The glass clock: the four instruments that stamp when a present reached the screen, and
//! their lifecycle per swapchain. The present-wait waiter, the `VK_EXT_present_timing`
//! engine, the DXGI vblank waiter (Windows, estimates) and the compositor's
//! `wp_presentation` feedback (Linux) are owned by [`GlassClock`] alone.
//!
//! The presenter sends an [`Event`] as a swapchain is made, retires, drains or overflows the
//! engine's result queue; [`lifecycle_step`] answers the [`Act`] the clock performs: arm the
//! engine on the new swapchain, drain the waiter, disarm the engine. The engine's count of
//! stamps asked and not yet reported moves on two threads (the presenter asks, the waiter's
//! poll reads the reports), so it lives in the engine; [`asks_after`] is its rule. The
//! waiter polls only while that count is above zero. [`Clocks::rank`] names the instrument
//! whose stamp the ledger reads.
//!
//! The model is pure, built and tested on every platform; the clock is Linux and Windows.
//! Pinned by the table tests below.
