//! The swap-chain drain worker's decisions, without the DDIs.
//!
//! The driver's `swap_chain_processor.rs` maps each DDI result into a [`Seen`], calls [`step`]
//! and does the [`Next`] it gets back. The DDI calls, their order and the acquire window (offer,
//! then `FinishedProcessingFrame`, nothing between) stay in that shell; this module only says
//! which one comes next.
//!
//! Every road back to an acquire passes the loop top, so a stop, a removed device or a gone
//! monitor is seen between any two frames, even while DWM composes without a pause.
//!
//! Design: `design/pf-vdisplay-driver-overhaul.md` §4 (D4) in the planning repo.
