//! The SteamOS takeover's restart verdict: what one look at the restarted
//! `gamescope-session.target` tells the connect to do.
//!
//! The shell (`gamescope.rs`, `create_managed_session_steamos`) restarts the target under a
//! budget, then looks at it until [`step`] stops waiting. A flags verdict is a one-way latch for
//! the host's life (`discovery.rs`, `note_spawn_flags_lost`), so it is only ever taken on a
//! gamescope that started after the restart: the previous session's stock compositor is no
//! evidence about ours. Built on every platform so the table runs without systemd.
//!
//! Design: `design/pf-vdisplay-host-overhaul.md` §3 D4 in the planning repo.
