//! The KWin output seam: where each output operation picks its half.
//!
//! Topology, position, custom mode, re-enable and list each run in-process over
//! `kde_output_management_v2` ([`super::mgmt`]) first. When that half declines, the reason is
//! one log line and `kscreen-doctor` ([`super::kscreen`]) runs once; [`Resolved`] names the half
//! that answered. [`gate`] is the in-process half's answer before it addresses an output: a
//! connection that is bound, caught up, and new enough for the request. [`plan`] decides a
//! topology from the outputs as a half reads them ([`Row`]); the half only stages it.
//!
//! Pinned by the tables in this file's tests: the fallback over (management bound, version,
//! barrier), the topology plan over the outputs it reads.
