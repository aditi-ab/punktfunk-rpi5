//! Whether a launched game has exited, decided once per poll.
//!
//! Pure: no clock of its own and no process table. The watcher gathers a [`Sighting`], hands
//! it to [`Presence::step`], and carries out the [`Verdict`] (`Watcher::watch_exit`).
//!
//! The order of the signals is the contract:
//! 1. The launch's own process leaving is the exit when nothing else names the game.
//! 2. A live process outranks every report.
//! 3. A provider's word is final both ways while its report is fresh.
//! 4. Otherwise the game exits once unseen for [`EXIT_CONFIRM`]; its launcher's running
//!    flag holds that off, up to [`VETO_LIMIT`].
//!
//! Pin with the table tests below. Design: `design/session-game-lifetime.md`.

// macOS has no watcher: only the tests read this module there.
