//! Host-side capture through a capture worker: a monitor the host did not create, captured
//! with Windows Graphics Capture and encoded in a process that runs as the signed-in user.
//!
//! [`WorkerLink`] is the host's end of one worker: its process handle, and the two pipes of
//! [`pf_driver_proto::worker`] behind a [`Link`], which checks and bounds everything the
//! worker sends. [`WorkerTransport`] is the remote source's edge over it: the worker owns the
//! pixels and the encoder, and publishes into the same AU section the driver does, so the
//! source and its encoder proxy are the driver's own.
//!
//! Evidence: `design/windows-wgc-capture.md` §4.3, §4.7, §4.13.
