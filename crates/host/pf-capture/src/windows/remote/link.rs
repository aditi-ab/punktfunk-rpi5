//! The host's end of one capture worker's control channel: the two pipes of
//! [`pf_driver_proto::worker`] and, as a [`Peer`], the process behind them.
//!
//! [`Link`] keeps one request in flight and waits a bound for its reply. The worker is less
//! privileged than this process: every reply is checked before use, a worker that answers
//! late or with the wrong bytes is ended, and nothing it sends is waited on without a bound.
//! A stream that stops being messages ends the channel, and a request that finds it ended
//! ends a worker that still runs.
//!
//! Generic over the pipes and the process, so the tests stand in for a worker on every
//! target; `wgc.rs` hands over the real ones. Evidence: `design/windows-wgc-capture.md`
//! §4.3, §4.7, §4.13.
