//! The IDD-push display depth pin: what the session negotiated, what the display composes,
//! and when a change re-opens the driver's encoder.
//!
//! [`DepthPin::step`] takes what the shell sampled ([`Sample`]) and returns what it must do
//! ([`PinAction`]). A poller sample may ask for a pin: the shell writes it, reads the colour
//! mode back and steps [`Sample::Pinned`]. A changed descriptor asks for the topology
//! generation; two agreeing samples under one generation re-open the encoder.
//! `idd/display.rs` runs the steps over [`DisplayColour`].
//!
//! The open and a re-arrival settle their pins for up to 250 ms: [`settle`], [`reassert_hdr`]
//! and [`pin_wcg`] run those loops over the seam, and [`hdr_at_open`], [`hdr_reasserted`] and
//! [`wcg_verdict`] decide what they settled at. All of it compiles on every target, so the
//! table below and the scripted display (`fake`) run on Linux and the Mac. A row per behaviour,
//! named for its fix where one exists; a new depth defect adds its row first.

// Off Windows only the tests read this module.
