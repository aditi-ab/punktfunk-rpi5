//! Host-side IDD-push capture: the driver encodes into a sealed AU section, so this side owns
//! no pixels, only the session's display (mode, HDR, cursor channel) around the [`RemoteSource`]
//! that delivers and supervises the driver's frames. Both sides `use` [`pf_driver_proto`], so
//! layout drift is a compile error. The `(pure)` files build on every target, from `windows/`.
//!
//! - `open_plan.rs`: every step an open takes, decided before any of it runs (pure).
//! - `open.rs`: the plan run against the display, the WUDFHost broker and the remote source.
//! - `channel.rs`: the WUDFHost handle broker and [`IddTransport`], the source's driver edge.
//! - `capturer.rs`: `try_consume`, one tick of the capture loop, and the `Capturer` surface.
//! - `tick.rs`: the tick's order around the remote source's phases (pure).
//! - `depth_pin.rs`: which depth the display holds; when a change re-opens the encoder (pure).
//! - `display.rs`: mode, colour depth and the encoder's output format, over `DisplayColour`.
//! - `descriptor.rs`: the off-thread sampler of the target's HDR, wide colour and mode.
//! - `cursor.rs`: the hardware-cursor channel's section, delivered to the driver.
//! - `cursor_model.rs`: the cursor model run against the driver and the two shape sources.
//! - `cursor_poll.rs`: the GDI poller: the pointer's position, visibility and fallback shape.
//! - `health.rs`: this source's end of the recovery ladder: its inputs, its local rungs.
//! - `stall.rs`: the log lines for a hole the stall watch found, with coinciding OS events.
//! - `probes.rs`: the stall-attribution probes: GPU engine, DWM, composition wait, KMD, CPU.
//! - `dxgkrnl_etw.rs`: the real-time DxgKrnl and DXGI ETW watch a stall report cites.
