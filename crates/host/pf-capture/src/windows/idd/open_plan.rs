//! The IDD-push open as a plan: every step a session's open takes, in order, decided before
//! any of it runs.
//!
//! [`plan_open`] turns what the session asked ([`OpenAsk`]) and what the host knows before
//! the open ([`DisplayFacts`]) into [`OpenStep`]s. [`run_colour`] runs the display's steps
//! over `DisplayColour`, with their 250 ms settle loops and log lines; `idd/open.rs` runs
//! the rest (the broker, the cursor channel, the diagnostics) and builds the capturer.
//!
//! Pure but for the seam, so a test per session kind runs the plan over a scripted display
//! on every target.

// Off Windows only the tests read this module.
