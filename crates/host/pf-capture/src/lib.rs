//! The host's capture sources: pixel sources the stream loop encodes, and remote-encoder
//! sources whose encoder runs in another process. Contract: `docs/adr/0001`.
//!
//! Roles: a source is a [`Capturer`] plus its roles. The host passes facts, not capture choices.
//! Model and shell: a model (enum state, `step`, table test) calls no OS; its shell does that.
//! Knobs: every `PUNKTFUNK_*` read is in `knobs.rs`; zero env reads elsewhere.
//!
//! - `capturer.rs`: the contract, its roles and events.
//! - `open.rs`: the request structs and the `open_*` entry points.
//! - `knobs.rs`: `Knobs`, every switch the crate reads, with its parser.
//! - `synthetic.rs`: sources with no display behind them.
//! - `fake.rs`: the stream loops' scripted source, behind `test-support`.
//! - `pts_provenance.rs`: which clock a Linux frame's wire stamp comes from.
//! - `pwinit.rs`: PipeWire's one-time init, shared with audio capture.
//! - `linux/`: the cells a capture shares with its thread, one buffer-to-frame delivery.
//! - `linux/pipewire/`: the PipeWire stream, from the portal monitor or a virtual output.
//! - `linux/direct/`: `ext-image-copy-capture-v1` into dmabufs this side allocates.
//! - `windows/`: the pure models every target tests, WGC, the GPU-preference hook.
//! - `windows/remote/`: one source for every remote encoder: transport, AU proxy, supervisor.
//! - `windows/idd/`: IDD-push, where the pf-vdisplay driver encodes.

// The frame vocabulary, at the crate root for every module's `crate::` imports.
