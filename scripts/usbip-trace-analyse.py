"""Walk a `PUNKTFUNK_USBIP_TRACE` capture and find where the two sides stop agreeing.

A USB/IP connection is a framed byte stream whose frame lengths are declared inside the frames, so
one reply that writes a different number of bytes than its header promises shifts everything after
it. The peer then fails at whatever frame happens to land badly, which is never the frame that was
wrong. This walks both directions as PDUs and reports the first frame that does not decode, plus a
per-URB ledger of declared vs. written bytes.

Usage:  usbip-trace-analyse.py /tmp/pad.virtual-DualSense-0
        (reads <prefix>.rx, <prefix>.tx, <prefix>.idx)
