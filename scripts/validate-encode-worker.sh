# WP3 — the on-glass validation kit for `punktfunk-encode-worker`.
#
# Plan: punktfunk-planning/design/gpu-priority-capability-worker-implementation-plan.md §2/WP3.
# This script is the mechanical half of that table. It runs ON a real box (Deck desktop mode, .21,
# .25, .41, a nobara VM); it needs a GPU, and for the KDE legs a live KDE session. Nothing here
# talks to another machine.
#
# WHAT IS BEING VALIDATED. `punktfunk-encode-worker` is a separate binary carrying
# `cap_sys_nice=ep`; it encodes PyroWave at an elevated VK_KHR_global_priority class so the encode
# dispatch can preempt a GPU-bound game. `punktfunk-host` carries NO capability, ever: KWin
# identifies a Wayland client by resolving its /proc/<pid>/exe, the kernel refuses that readlink to
# any reader whose effective set is not a superset of the target's PERMITTED set
# (cap_ptrace_access_check), KWin holds no capabilities — so a capability-carrying host is
# unidentifiable, `zkde_screencast_unstable_v1` is never advertised, and every KDE desktop session
# loses streaming. That is the 0.26.0-1 field incident, and V1 below is its regression test.
#
# SAFE BY DEFAULT. With no arguments this only READS: /proc, getcap, the installed .desktop. It
# starts no session, kills nothing, and never calls setcap. Every leg that runs a capture+encode
# session must be named explicitly; the one leg that kills a process needs --allow-mutate on top.
# This script NEVER setcaps anything, least of all the host — it asserts the host is uncapped and
# hard-fails if it is not, which is the entire point of V1.
#
# SKIPPED IS NOT A PASS. A leg that cannot run prints SKIP with the reason and the exit code says
# so (2). Only PASS counts, and anything this script cannot determine is reported, never assumed.
#
#   Usage:  scripts/validate-encode-worker.sh [LEG ...] [OPTIONS]
#           scripts/validate-encode-worker.sh recipe      # the per-box human recipe, incl. sudo
#           scripts/validate-encode-worker.sh --help
#
#   Legs:
#     inspect  (default) pure read-only inspection: the capability matrix as it exists on THIS box,
#              plus every running host's runtime capability state. No session, no spawn.
#     v1       the 0.26.0-1 regression test — KDE only.
#     v2       grant: the worker reports REALTIME.
#     v3a      IPC hop cost: in-process vs an UNCAPPED worker, both at default GPU priority.
#              R1's pre-registered abandonment gate. Needs no capability and no KDE.
#     v3b      lever benefit: in-process at default priority vs the CAPPED worker.
#     v4       the fallback ladder (chaos). Read-only rungs by default; --allow-mutate adds kill -9.
#     v5       fd hygiene over a long session (default 10 min).
#     auto     inspect + v1 + v2 + v3a + v4 — everything that needs no extra permission.
#     all      auto + v3b + v5.
#     recipe   the per-box human recipe, including the privileged steps this script will not run.
#     selftest red-team this kit's own readers against synthetic logs. No box, no GPU, no Linux —
#              run it before trusting a green run, because an assertion that cannot fail is not one.
#
# ⚠ USE INSTALLED PATHS ON THE KDE LEGS. KWin caches the grant per EXECUTABLE PATH, matched against
#   an installed .desktop's `Exec=`. A binary run from a scratch build directory is a different
#   path, so KWin refuses it and `zkde_screencast_unstable_v1` never appears. That is identification
#   WORKING, not a bug — do not go debugging KWin. This script resolves the host binary from the
#   installed .desktop precisely so the legs run against the path KWin knows.
#
# ⚠ THE WORKER'S PERF SUMMARY GOES TO INHERITED STDERR. The p50/p99 lines are emitted by the worker
#   process, whose stderr is the host's. They reach `journalctl`; they do NOT reach the web
#   console's Logs tab (that ring is a tracing layer INSIDE the host process). This kit runs the
#   spike itself and captures stderr directly, so it never depends on either.

# No `set -e`. This harness deliberately runs commands that are EXPECTED to fail (a readlink that
# must be refused, a worker that must not spawn); under -e a normal negative result aborts the run
# and looks like a crash. Every fallible call below checks its own status instead.

RECIPE — what a human has to do, per box
========================================

Everything below runs ON the box, from a shell inside the graphical session (the KDE legs need
WAYLAND_DISPLAY set to the KDE socket — an ssh shell has neither that nor XDG_RUNTIME_DIR unless
you export them).

  export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u)
  export WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-0        # check `ls $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/wayland-*`

⚠ USE THE INSTALLED BINARY. KWin caches its per-executable grant against the path in the installed
  .desktop's Exec=. A build run from a scratch directory is a different path and KWin refuses it —
  that is identification working. This kit resolves the host from the .desktop for exactly that
  reason; only override with --host-bin if you know the installed path.

--- every box, first ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  scripts/validate-encode-worker.sh                    # pure inspection, changes nothing
This is also the fastest way to see whether the worker is installed and capped at all.

--- Steam Deck (deck@192.168.1.253), DESKTOP mode -- V1 + V2 -------------------------------------
The Deck is the RADV half of V2 and the KWin×RADV half of V1. /usr is read-only (SteamOS); the
install is home-scoped under ~/punktfunk, and file capabilities do NOT survive a rebuild (a rebuild
is a new inode).

  1. PRIVILEGED, run by a human — sudo on the Deck needs the `deck` password, it is NOT passwordless.
     This also writes ~/.local/share/applications/io.unom.Punktfunk.Host.desktop, which V1 needs and
     which is NOT currently present on that box:

         cd ~/punktfunk && scripts/steamdeck/install.sh

     Then LOG OUT AND BACK IN. KWin reads the .desktop when the client first connects and caches the
     grant; an already-running session will not pick up a newly written file.

  2. Verify by hand, no root needed:
         getcap ~/punktfunk/target-steamos/release/punktfunk-host            # MUST print nothing
         getcap ~/punktfunk/target-steamos/release/punktfunk-encode-worker   # cap_sys_nice=ep

  3. Unprivileged, from a Desktop-mode terminal:
         scripts/validate-encode-worker.sh inspect v1 v2 v4

--- .21 CachyOS KDE / RTX 5070 Ti -- the A/B home -------------------------------------------------
PW1's baselines live here and nowhere else, so V3b is only comparable to them on this box. It needs
a GPU-BOUND LOAD: start the game (PW1 used the GRID 2 benchmark loop, steam:44350, at 54-87% GPU)
and leave it running for both arms.

         scripts/validate-encode-worker.sh inspect v1 v2 v3a v3b v4 v5

--- .25 Ubuntu 26.04 (enricobuehler@192.168.1.25) -- V3a/V4/V5 + the deb leg ----------------------
No KDE at all (sway only), so V1 cannot run there and will SKIP with that reason. V3a needs neither
a capability nor KDE, which is the point of splitting it out.

         scripts/validate-encode-worker.sh inspect v3a v4 v5 --source portal

--- V4.e's second half: the respawn rung needs a REAL session -------------------------------------
v4.e kills the worker under `spike`, and `spike` has no encoder-recovery loop — submit errors
propagate and it exits. `Encoder::reset` is therefore never called, and reset is the ONLY emitter of
"the encode worker died mid-session" / "respawned the encode worker". So the leg asserts the half it
can see (the death is surfaced as an attributable worker-IPC error, host still alive) and leaves the
respawn to a real session. To close it, with a client connected and streaming:

         pkill -f punktfunk-encode-worker
         journalctl --user -u punktfunk-host -b | grep -E 'died mid-session|respawned|rebuilt in place'

Expect the stream never to drop, plus "respawned the encode worker after a mid-session death
priority=Granted(Realtime)" and "encoder submit failed — encoder rebuilt in place, forcing an IDR
reset=1 max=5". Confirmed on home-nobara-1 (KDE, RTX 5070 Ti) 2026-08-10.

--- the one step this script will never do --------------------------------------------------------
It never calls setcap. If a leg says the worker is uncapped and you want the lever:

         sudo setcap 'cap_sys_nice=ep' /path/to/punktfunk-encode-worker

NEVER setcap punktfunk-host. Not "temporarily", not "to test". A capability on the host makes it
unidentifiable to KWin and takes out desktop streaming on every KDE box — that is 0.26.0-1, and I2
above hard-fails on it. To undo one:  sudo setcap -r /path/to/punktfunk-host

--- reading the logs afterwards -------------------------------------------------------------------
Every fallback rung ends with the same clause, so one grep finds them all whichever rung fired:

         journalctl --user -u punktfunk-host -b | grep -F 'encoding in-process at default GPU priority'

⚠ The worker's PUNKTFUNK_PERF p50/p99 summary is written by the WORKER process to inherited stderr.
  It reaches journalctl. It does NOT reach the web console's Logs tab — that ring is a tracing layer
  inside the host process and the worker is not in it. Read the journal, not the console.
