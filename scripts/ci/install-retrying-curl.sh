# Put a retrying `curl` first on PATH for the rest of the job.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: `scripts/ci/retry.sh` already wraps every single-shot network command in CI,
# for the reason documented there — the runner box runs many jobs in parallel and its network
# drops packets under that load. But one of the biggest fetches in this workspace is NOT ours to
# wrap: skia-bindings downloads ~19 MB of prebuilt Skia per target from inside its build script,
# with a bare `curl -sS -f -L` and no retry at all (build_support/binary_cache/utils.rs).
#
# When that transfer truncates the job does not fail with a network error. skia-bindings'
# `try_prepare_download` swallows it, prints `DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL FAILED`, and falls through to
# `STARTING A FULL BUILD` — a from-source Skia build that the CI containers carry no deps for.
# What the operator sees is a Gradle stack trace under "Clippy (Android target)" with the real
# cause 1,800 lines up. Measured on main 2026-08-22:
#
#   DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL FAILED: curl error code: "18"
#   curl stderr: "curl: (18) end of response with 17054400 bytes missing"
#
# (19,057,024 bytes on the wire; it got 2 MB before git.unom.io closed the connection. The same
# asset pulls fine from a dev box, so this is the load-shedding retry.sh was written for.)
#
# A shim is the only lever that reaches inside a build script. It is also the cheapest correct
# one: skia-bindings already passes `-C -` (resume) and caches the part-file under
# OUT_DIR/.cache, so a retry CONTINUES the truncated transfer instead of restarting it.
#
# Applies to every curl in the job, which is what we want — the workspace's other build-script
# fetches are single-shot too.
#
# POSIX sh on purpose: Gitea's act_runner executes a step's `run:` under `sh -e` (dash) inside
# the Linux job containers — see the shader-gate note in ci.yml for what assuming bash cost.
#
# Usage:  sh scripts/ci/install-retrying-curl.sh

# Resolve the REAL curl before the shim is on PATH, and bake the absolute path into the shim —
# a shim that re-resolves `curl` by name would exec itself.
