# backends went native (2026-09-07). Delete a stale C:\Users\Public\ffmpeg by hand; this script

# --- No Vulkan-Headers here any more: they existed only for pf-ffvk's bindgen over
# libavutil/hwcontext_vulkan.h, and that crate is gone (M10). Nothing punktfunk builds on Windows
# needs Vulkan headers at compile time - ash generates its own bindings and dlopens vulkan-1.dll,
# which is a GPU-driver component. A stale C:\Users\Public\vulkan-headers is harmless; delete it
# by hand if you want the disk back. ---

# --- Inno Setup provisioning removed: the installers are packed by punktfunk-setup-win, which is
# a workspace crate and needs nothing on the runner. A leftover Inno Setup 6 install is harmless;
# uninstall it by hand if you want the disk back. ---

# VB-CABLE provisioning removed (the audio-substrate program, 2026-08): the installer no longer
# bundles a cable - the host mints its audio endpoints from Steam's streaming drivers on the
# target box. A stale C:\Users\Public\vbcable on a runner is harmless and can be deleted.

# --- The runner daemon's punktfunk env extension point (unom/infra's
# scripts/setup-gitea-runner-base.ps1) is now empty: FFMPEG_DIR and its PATH prepend were the only
# entries and nothing links FFmpeg any more. Clear a file an older run wrote. ---

# --- Azure Artifact Signing (formerly Trusted Signing) toolchain, for the signing step in
# windows-host.yml + windows-client.yml. Two pieces, neither of which the generic unom/infra image
# carries, and both of which fail in ways that do not name themselves:
#
#   1. The .NET 8 runtime. Azure.CodeSigning.Dlib.dll is a mixed-mode (C++/CLI) assembly - it ships
#      Ijwhost.dll and a runtimeconfig.json pinning Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.0 - so on a box with
#      no .NET runtime, signtool exits 3 having printed NOTHING AT ALL. Verified on .133 2026-08-14:
#      the box had pwsh 7 (self-contained, brings no shared runtime) and no dotnet whatsoever.
#   2. The signing client, installed MACHINE-WIDE under C:\trusted-signing rather than into a user's
#      .nuget. The act_runner daemon runs as SYSTEM, whose USERPROFILE is
#      C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile - so a per-user install under Administrator is
#      invisible to every job that actually builds. Find-AzureDlib in both pack scripts searches
#      this exact path for that reason; verified by resolving it from a SYSTEM scheduled task.
#
# Both are SHA-256 pinned against version-immutable URLs (a nuget.org flat-container package and the
# dotnet builds CDN are both immutable per version), so these fail closed on tampering rather than
# every time Microsoft ships a patch release. Bump version + hash together to move either. ---
