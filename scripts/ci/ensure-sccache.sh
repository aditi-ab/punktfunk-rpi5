# Ensure `sccache` is on PATH, self-healing on a runner/image that does not already carry it.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: this block was copy-pasted into ten jobs across six workflows (ci.yml x2,
# deb.yml x3, rpm.yml, bench.yml, apple.yml x2, the Apple release leg), in two dialects that had
# already drifted apart — the Linux copies pass `--wildcards` to GNU tar, the macOS copies must NOT
# (bsdtar globs by default and rejects the flag). One copy per platform, here, so a version bump or
# a mirror change is one edit rather than ten.
#
# The builder images (ci/*.Dockerfile) BAKE sccache, so on Linux this is a no-op in the normal case;
# it stays because a job runs against the image from the PREVIOUS push (docker.yml's bootstrap lag),
# and the macOS runner is a persistent host with no image at all.
#
# POSIX sh on purpose: Gitea's act_runner executes a step's `run:` under `sh -e` (dash) inside the
# Linux job containers — no bashisms, no process substitution (see the shader-gate note in ci.yml
# for what that cost the last time someone assumed bash).
#
# Usage:  sh scripts/ci/ensure-sccache.sh
set -e

# Keep in step with the ARG SCCACHE_VERSION in ci/*.Dockerfile — the images bake this same version,
# and a job that heals to a DIFFERENT one would quietly split the shared cache's key universe in two
# (sccache's cache keys are not versioned across incompatible releases).
SCCACHE_VERSION="${SCCACHE_VERSION:-0.10.0}"

# Fork PRs do not receive SCCACHE_* secrets. CMake stores the launcher name
# `sccache` in the build dir (and in a restored target/ cache), so the name has
# to keep resolving — shadow it with a passthrough shim earlier on PATH. Never
# overwrite the installed binary: the macOS runner is a persistent host, and a
# clobbered binary stays broken for every job that follows this one.
