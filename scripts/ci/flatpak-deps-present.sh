# Does this box already have every Flathub dep a flatpak manifest declares?
#   bash scripts/ci/flatpak-deps-present.sh <manifest.yml>   -> exit 0 = yes, 1 = no
#   bash scripts/ci/flatpak-deps-present.sh --self-test      -> run the asserts below
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: flatpak.yml used to prefetch deps with `flatpak-builder --install-deps-only`,
# which does NOT mean "install what is missing". builder_manifest_install_dep() branches on
# `flatpak info --show-commit <ref>` succeeding and runs `flatpak update` for every dep that IS
# installed (a failed update is fatal there — it never falls back to install) — and
# ci/flatpak-ci.Dockerfile bakes the whole runtime set, so on a healthy run that flag did nothing
# except make the build depend on Flathub being up at that minute. On 2026-08-22 it took the job
# down: dl.flathub.org returned HTTP 404 for one .filez object of the then-current
# rust-stable//25.08 commit, identically on all 10 retry.sh attempts (~9 min), and flatpak-builder
# segfaulted on its own error path (rc=139) so the retry wrapper could not tell a dead end from a
# blip. Nothing about the build wanted that newer commit: the manifest pins a runtime VERSION, not
# a commit, and the baked one satisfies it.
#
# So the workflow asks this first and only reaches for Flathub on a real miss.
#
# FAILS OPEN, deliberately: an unreadable/unexpected manifest reports "not present" (1), so the
# caller does the full install. Silently skipping the install on a manifest we stopped
# understanding is how you build against the wrong runtime.
