#   1) On the box with the GPU (Deck: prefix RADV_PERFTEST=video_decode):
#        PF_VKD_FIELD_STREAM=/path/au-XXXX.h265 \
#          cargo test -p pf-vkdecode --test gpu_parity --release -- \
#          --ignored field_h265 --nocapture
#      This writes /path/au-XXXX.h265.pfhash (one SHA-256 per frame, display order).
#   2) Anywhere with ffmpeg ≥ 6 (this script):
#        scripts/vkdecode-field-parity.sh /path/au-XXXX.h265
#
# A divergence at frame 0 points at intra decode, the parameter-set conversion or
# readback geometry; a LATER first divergence points at inter prediction,
# reference info or DPB management — and everything after it is probably just
# downstream of that one frame. Re-run half 1 with PF_VKD_FIELD_YUV=<n>,<n+1> to
# dump the divergent frames' planes for visual inspection.
