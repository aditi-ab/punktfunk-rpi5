# Brings up the full desktop, not just the compositor, and waits for it to be *actually
# ready* before starting the portals/plasma — no blind `sleep`. A bare session is missing
# pieces a full Plasma login would start, so this also: exports the Xwayland DISPLAY (X11 apps
# like Steam need it), starts the polkit authentication agent (Discover/PackageKit need it to
# authorize installs), and supervises plasmashell (it draws wallpaper + panels; a crash must
# not leave the desktop gone). The env matters: without XDG_MENU_PREFIX=plasma- the launcher
# resolves ${XDG_MENU_PREFIX}applications.menu → "applications.menu", which doesn't exist on KDE
# installs (it ships plasma-applications.menu) — plasmashell runs fine but the menu is EMPTY.

# display up front, which the detection below reads.

# /tmp. This file is not just a log: the DISPLAY detection below GREPS it for "Using public X11
# display :N" and exports the result, so at a predictable path in a shared directory any local user
# could pre-create it (or symlink it) and steer the DISPLAY of a shipped systemd service
# (2026-08-05 review L-15). `pf-vdisplay` already resolves XDG_RUNTIME_DIR for its own paths; this
# matches. Without a runtime dir, fall back to a private mktemp rather than a guessable name.
