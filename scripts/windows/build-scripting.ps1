  Rebuild the plugin/script runner bundle from the CURRENT sdk/ source and lay it out next to the
  host exe, so `punktfunk-host plugins ...` works and the PunktfunkScripting task runs new code.

    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\windows\build-scripting.ps1
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\windows\build-scripting.ps1 -EnableTask

  WHY the layout matters: the plugins CLI forwards package ops (add/remove/list) to the runner, and
  on Windows it resolves the runner RELATIVE TO THE RUNNING EXE - <exe-dir>\bun\bun.exe and
  <exe-dir>\scripting\runner-cli.js (crates\punktfunk-host\src\plugins.rs). deploy-host.ps1 runs the
  service out of target\release, so a bundle sitting only in the installed {app} leaves the freshly
  built exe reporting "the plugin runner isn't installed". We therefore deploy next to EVERY host exe
  we can find: the built one, and whatever the PunktfunkHost service actually runs.

  The PunktfunkScripting task ships DISABLED (opt-in). We do not silently enable it - pass
  -EnableTask on a dev box you are validating plugins on.
