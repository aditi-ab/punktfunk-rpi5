# Derive the per-client host-OS-icon assets from the assets/os-icons masters.
#
# The masters are monochrome `fill="currentColor"` SVGs, one per icon token of the host's
# OS-identity chain (see assets/os-icons/README.md). Three clients need a baked derivative
# because they cannot consume the master directly:
#
#   GTK shell     symbolic SVG, black fill  -> clients/linux/data/icons/scalable/actions/
#   Windows shell PNG, h=96, white          -> clients/windows/assets/os/
#   Apple clients vector PDF, black fill    -> clients/apple/.../OsIcons.xcassets/
#
# The Skia console, the web console, the Decky plugin and the Android client inline the path
# data instead; scripts/gen_os_mark_table.py generates those four registries.
#
# Idempotent. Usage: bash scripts/gen-os-icons.sh [token ...]   (default: every master)

# The Windows shell has no vector element and no theme-aware tint, so its PNGs bake in one
# colour. That colour is WHITE, because the shell draws these in exactly one place: the host
# card's avatar, an accent-filled circle on both themes. (It was mid-grey while the mark sat
# in the card's status row instead — grey is what stays legible on a card face, and it read
# as smudged the moment the mark moved onto the accent fill.) Tall, because it is now the
# card's leading visual rather than the smallest glyph in a row.
