// Omarchy renders every registered `~/.config/omarchy/themed/*.tpl` from the active theme's
// semantic `colors.toml` on each `omarchy-theme-set`, dropping the result in
// `~/.local/state/omarchy/current/theme/`. We register `punktfunk.json.tpl` (installed by
// `punktfunk-omarchy setup`, opt-in), so the file below is the theme expressed in exactly the four
// values the console can act on.
//
// Deliberately a FILE read and not an integration: there is no Omarchy API to call, the host learns
// nothing, and a box that never opted in simply has no file — which is why every failure here is
// "no theme", never an error. The console's own palette is the fallback and always was.
//
// All four values are carried, not just the accent: an accent alone leaves the console's own violet
// chrome under a themed button, which is what "the theme is not fully applied" means in practice.
// `styles.css` mixes the surfaces out of the background/foreground pair.
