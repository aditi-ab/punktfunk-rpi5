 * looking at was `https://host:47992`, and the browser refused to frame the plugin
 * (`ERR_BLOCKED_BY_RESPONSE`) — an empty panel with the explanation only in the devtools console.
 * The scheme-part upgrade in CSP3 (an `http` source also matching an `https` URL) does NOT rescue
 * this: Chromium enforces `frame-ancestors` against the ancestor's origin strictly. Verified on
 * glass, 2026-08-06.
